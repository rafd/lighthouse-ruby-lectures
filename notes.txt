# PUSH

sometimes, we want the server to be able to 'push' a message to the client (immediately, based on some event)

ex. chat app, email client, game, screen-share




## PUSH with HTTP

  HTTP is a request-response protocol, so, the only way the server can send a message to the client is if the client makes the request first

  ...but, there are ways to implement "push" with HTTP:

  - POLLING

    - client asks for an update every ~1 sec (using ajax)

  - LONG POLLING

    - client asks for an update (ie. ajax request)
      - server keeps connection open until it has something to send
      - server sends a response
    - client receives response
    - client immediately asks for an update again (ie. ajax request)





## WEBSOCKETS

  - ws is another protocol that browsers understand
    - text-based protocol (ie. not binary)
    - guaranteed message send/receive
    - bidirectional
      - (can send messages client->server, server->client)
      - (both sides can start sending data at any time)
    - persistent connection
      - (ie. client connects, connection kept open)
    - client/server
      - client knows of one server
      - server manages receive/sending messages between many clients
      - ```
               <-> CLIENT
        SERVER <-> CLIENT
               <-> CLIENT
        ```

  - benefits over polling/long-polling with ajax:

    - less connection overhead
       - w/ HTTP, keep having to make/drop connections (this introduces a delay)
       - w/ ws, connect once, keep connection open
       - = better ping

    - less message overhead
       - w/ HTTP, headers + cookies on every message
       - w/ ws, ~0 message overhead
       - = better ping, less bandwidth

    - slightly nicer API

  - websockets is ideal for:
    - lots of data (high bandwith)
    - minimal delay (low ping, low latency)

  - real-time game -> websockets!
  - chat client -> polling/long-polling is fine, websockets ok too

  - up to you to come up with names for events
    - typically send JSON back and forth (manually using JSON.stringify and JSON.parse)

  - websockets api:
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API
    - well supported: http://caniuse.com/#search=websocket

  - socket.io  ("jquery for websockets")
    - http://socket.io/
    - cross-browser API
    - takes care of "rooms"
    - takes care of JSON conversion
    - automatic fallback to ajax (long polling / polling)




## CHAT CODE EXAMPLE:

  - client->server message types:
    - register
    - message
    - mousemove

  - server->client message types:
    - message
    - mousemove

  - potential improvements:
    - show previous messages (before a user joined the chat room)
    - when creating message and moving mouse, update the local state immediately (currently we update it when we receive the message back from the server)
    - remove dots of disconnected users
    - show name of user beside dot
    - security:
      - don't allow duplicate names
      - character-encode the name (to prevent injection attacks)
      - limit name to be something that can be within the #id attribute


## WEBRTC

  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/WebRTC

  another "protocol"!

  - API over UDP   (whereas WS is a text API over TCP)
  - peer-to-peer (!!!)
  - binary
  - can lose data, can be out of order (depending on network)

  - perfect for video/audio streaming
  - also used for secure chat

## UDP? TCP?
