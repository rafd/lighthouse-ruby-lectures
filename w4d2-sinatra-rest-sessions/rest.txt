REST

way of organizing routes for resources
“resource” ~= Model/Class ~= Table (most of the time, but sometimes an abstraction, ex. sessions)

GET /things
  lists all things;
     Thing.all

GET /things/:id
  info about id;
    Thing.find(id)

GET /things/:id/edit
  form for editing thing

GET /things/new
  form for new thing

POST /things (w/ thing data)
  create a new thing;
    Thing.create(params)

POST /things/:id (w/ thing data)
  update a thing;
    Thing.find(id).update(params).save()

DELETE /things/:id
   delete a thing
      Thing.find(id).destroy
