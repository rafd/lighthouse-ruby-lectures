pry
  irb++
  http://pryrepl.org/
  key feature: jump into a certain point in your program, check variables

  require 'pry'
  binding.pry


require vs. require_relative

  require "a"
    will look for the file based on *the directory the program is RUN from*
    only use require for gems

  require_relative "relative/path/to/file"
    will look for the file based on *the driectory the FILE is in*
    always use require_relative for files

  (both require and require_relative will only load a file once, even if you require it multiple times -- this is likely to happen when you have many files requiring many other files, etc.)
  every file that depends on another should require_relative those files


regex groups

  http://rubular.com/ very useful tool

  you can extract sub-matches using regex groups  (whenever you use brackets inside a regex)

  m = /(\d{3}).?(\d{3}).?(\d{4})/.match("416-123-4567")

  #=> #<MatchData "416-123-4567" 1:"416" 2:"123" 3:"4567">

  MatchData can be accessed like an array, first result is the entire match, the rest are the groups


  String#gsub can be passed a block, which has groups defined as $1, $2...

  pattern = /(\d{3}).?(\d{3}).?(\d{4})/

  "123-456-7890".gsub(pattern) do
     $2+$1+"XXXX"
   end

  #=> "456123XXXX"

  or, even more succinctly:

  "123-456-7890".gsub(pattern, '\2\1XXXX')   # note the single quotes!!!

  #=> "456123XXXX


p vs puts

  puts will convert the value into a string
    makes it hard to tell the difference between "" and [] and nil

  p will convert the value into a string with Ruby-like syntax
    ex. empty string => "\""\"
    ex. []  =>  "[]"

  if you want to print a value for debugging purposes, use p


enumerables

  http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html
  Array, Hashes (and other classes) are subclasses of Enumerable
    meaning that they all share the methods defined on Enumerable

  #each - do something with each element
    ["a","b","c"].each do |x,i|
      puts "#{i}: x"
    end
    # 1: a
    # 2: b
    # 3: c

    # we use each b/c we want the 'sideffects' of the block
    # note: each returns the original array, which is useless, so we never assign the result of each to anything (but watch out when using it at the end of a function, b/c it WILL return a value!)

  #map - return list with block applied to every item
    [1,2,3,4].map { |x| x * 2 }
    # [2,4,6,8]

  #find - return first thing where block returns true
    [1,2,3,4].find { |x| x % 2 == 0 }
    # 2

  #select - return list with items where block returns true
    [1,2,3,4].select { |x| x % 2 == 0 }
    # [2,4]

  #reduce - block defines how to combine elements into a new object
    very powerful, most other enumerable methods can be implemented w/ reduce
    also called inject (and fold in other languages)

    block is passed in two parameters
      first:
        often called "memo"
        is whatever was return-ed by the previous iteration of the block
        can be initialized by passing a value to the reduce function
          (otherwise, skips first item and uses it as initial value of memo)
      second:
        the current item

    see reduce.rb for examples

    sum:
      [1,2,3,4].reduce(0) do |memo,x|
        memo + x
      end
      # 10

    max:
      [5,1,3,6,2].reduce do |max,n|
        max > n ? max : n
      end
      # 6

    filter:
      [5,1,3,6,2].reduce([]) do |memo,x|
        x > 3 ? memo.push(x) : memo
      end
      # [5, 6]

    count occurrences:
      ["a","b","c","d","a","b","a","c"].reduce({}) do |memo,x|
        memo[x] ||= 0
        memo[x] += 1
      end
      # {"a" => 3, "b" => 2, "c" => 2, "d" => 1}




blocks
  we've already seen them used by some methods (ex. #each)
  can make our own methods that take in blocks
    just have to call 'yield()' inside our method
    can only take in one block
  useful to pass in some code/logic to a method

  see blocks.rb for examples

  ruby also has related things called procs & lambdas, but (sadly) they are very rarely used when writing idiomatic Ruby (ie. don't use them)
    we will see lambdas in javascript though! :)
