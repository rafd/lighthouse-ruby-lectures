cookies:
  server asks client to keep track of keys->values; client will include them in every future request
  in practise, only used to keep track of things you don't mind losing after the user logs out (very few things)

  sinatra gives you a "cookie" hash, available to use inside your routes
     will come prepopulated with the cookie
     the response will automatically include any changes to the cookie
     (you may need to enable it in your sinatra project: http://www.sinatrarb.com/contrib/cookies.html)

  ex. setting
    cookies[:foo] = "bar"
  ex. getting (in another request)
    cookies[:foo]
  ex. clearing
    cookies[:foo] = nil

sessions:
  abstraction on top of cookies, preventing user from manipulating the data in the cookie (through encryption)
  in practise, used to store the user id (ex. id = 58); all other data is requested from the database

  sinatra does all the encryption/decryption for you, so using them is just like cookies
     (you may need to enable it in your sinatra project: http://www.sinatrarb.com/faq.html#sessions)

  ex. setting
    session[:foo] = "bar"
  ex. getting (in another request)
    session[:foo]
  ex. clearing
    session.clear

still not sufficient to be secure,
  need to ALSO use SSL (https) in production servers
  so that all communications between browser<->server are encrypted
  otherwise:
    1) login usernames / passwords sent in plain text, can be read by anycomputer between browser<-> (wifi router, network provider, Rogers, NSA, etc.)
    2) b/c sessions are also text, they can be stolen by any computer along the path and used to login as someone

    these aren't "fairy-tale" problems, there have been real-world cases that have taken advantage of this
